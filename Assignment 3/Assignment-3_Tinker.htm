			<div class="PyC">
			<h2 style="font-family:Verdana" id="C6"> Python</h2>
			<p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected. </p>
		</div>
		<div class="PyC">
			<h2 > C </h2>
			<p>C is an imperative procedural language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. C is one of the foundational programming languages used in the development of compilers, operating systems, and embedded systems where speed and efficiency matter.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="htmlJavaScript">
			<h2>HTML</h2>
			<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity to make it look and function better.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="htmlJavaScript">
		<h2>JavaScript</h2>
		<p>JavaScript is a programming language used to create dynamic content for websites. It is a lightweight, cross-platform, and single-threaded programming language. It's an interpreted language that executes code line by line, providing more flexibility.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="SQLDart">
		<h2>SQL</h2>
		<p>SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a domain-specific language used for managing and manipulating data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). It is the standard language for interacting with databases that store data in a structured, tabular format, with rows and columns.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="SQLDart">
		<h2>Dart</h2>
		<p>Dart is a client-optimized, object-oriented programming language created by Google for building fast apps on any platform, including mobile, web, and desktop. It is the language that powers the Flutter framework, enabling developers to create cross-platform applications with a single codebase. Dart is known for its productive developer experience, featuring sub-second hot reload, type safety, and null safety, which help reduce errors and improve reliability.</p>
